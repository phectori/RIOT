## About
This is a test application for the BME280 Pressure, Temperature and
Humidity sensor.

## Usage
The application will initialize the BME280 device and display its
calibration coefficients. More information can be found in datasheet
document BST-BME280-DS001-11.

Notice that it is necessary to first read the temperature even if only one
of the other values (humidity or pressure) is needed. This is example in
the above mentioned datasheet.

After initialization, every 2 seconds, the application:
* reads and displays the temperature (dÂ°C);
* reads and displays the pressure (Pa);
* reads and displays the humidity (%rH);
